## TEST DATA - file name & details
## Labels (Title, X & Y axis), default = ""
#Title Main	this is only a test
#X Leg	miRNA
#Y Leg	meh
####
## Set the size of the labels, the distance between the axis labels and the values & the axis value size
## DEF: "Title Size:32", "Axis Label Size:26", "Axis Label Sep:20", "Axis Value Size: 26"
####
## Set the size of the y axis and the interval
#Y Max	15
#Y Interval	1
####
## "Y Value Rig:FALSE" -> manipulate the y-axis labels (0 or FALSE = no change; SCI = use scientific notation; # = divide all data by #  incl axis values -> make note on axis label!)
## "Y Value Rig Newline:FALSE" -> newline between Y Leg and rigging note
## "X Value Angle:45" -> Set the angle for X axis values (0 = no rotation, number = degree rotation)
## "Coord Fixed Ratio:SQUARE" -> Coordinate ratio (FALSE: disabled, SQUARE: 1/(Y Max / # of X Groups)
##     Manually enter ratio (eg 1/2, 1/3): ratio (x/y) uses the Y Max and number of X GROUPS) largely overwritten by ggsave function
## "HLine:#" -> set a horizontal line at # on the figure
####
## Colors list can handle "," and " " when splitting
#Colors	#000000, #606060, #00c000, #f71480, #0000ff, #ff0000, #000000, #606060, #00c000, #f71480, #0000ff, #ff0000
####
## Stats Labels: Stat offset (FALSE: default value is guessed for a Letter Size of 12, Y Max value & image export of 1800x935; override with a number)
## DEF: "Stat Offset:FALSE", "Stat Letter Size:18", "Stat Caption Display:TRUE", "Stat Caption Size:6"
####
## "Stats Test:ANOVA" -> what type of primary test to carry out (ANOVA, TTest, PTTest), a combination is possible (use multiple lines)
## ANOVA = ANOVA w/ Tukeys Post Hoc Test; STTest = unpaired TTest; PTTest = Wilcoxen Paired TTest
#Stats Test	ANOVA
#Stats Test	STTest
#Stats Test	PTTest
## "Stats Post Test:Tukeys" -> the post hoc test to run ** IN PLANNING - currently ALL are Tukeys... **
## the comparisons -> in Group1_Group2 format, final is symbol that is placed over group in second position (make sure Group1 is dropped group)
## final col is optional & determines tails (two.sided, greater, less) compares Group1 greater/less than Group1, two.sided is default
## IF data is being separated based on group2 - make sure that the group1_group2 comparisons are within the same group2...
#Stats PTTest Pairs	NT_24hrs	22_24hrs	!	less
#Stats PTTest Pairs	NT_24hrs	122_24hrs	@	two.sided
## TTest combinations
#Stats STTest Pairs	NT_48hrs	22_48hrs	a
#Stats STTest Pairs	NT_48hrs	122_48hrs	b	less
####
## "Stats Transform:TreatmentControl:Group1:Group2" -> the transformation to carry out (eg treatment over control) followed by group1 & group2 to use as control 
## will be used to normalize all other groups and will be removed from the figure, a line will be automatically added at '1' for this group
## ANOVA (if requested) will be run post transform & group removal; in order to remove a group (treatment) "Stats Anova Group2" MUST be set to FALSE!
## "Stats Transform:TimeCourse" -> group1 defines the time points; groupt 2 the control & treatment/s 
## "Stats Outlier:ONE" -> Outlier detection - (FALSE, ONE, TWO) false: no detection; one: one tailed; two: two tailed (careful when using paired t-tests)
####
## "Stats Anova Group2:FALSE" -> how are the groups compared for the ANOVA test?
## TRUE: compare only within each group2 & include borders around each; FALSE: compare between all the group2's [a unique Group1_Group2 id is always generated]
#Stats Anova Group2	TRUE
## "Facet Split:TRUE" -> Should the figure be split into multiple ones based on the Group2?
## True includes the Group2 value as a header above the figure / section of the figure
#Facet Split	TRUE
####
## Make sure that Group1 has adequate labels to distinguish any repeats in Group2...
